# Encryptify
Encryptify is a Python-based tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a unique, randomly generated key. It features both a command-line interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The tool saves the encryption key in a JSON file for reuse and works across multiple platforms like Windows and Linux.
